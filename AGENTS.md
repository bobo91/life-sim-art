# Agent operating rules — Life Sim Art
Owner: Codex. Art repository for bobo91/life-sim-game (Claude Code).
## Mission
Generate all final 3D meshes and materials from scratch for a cohesive stylized low-poly 3D adult life simulator in a modern American small town.
## Rules
- No purchased packs, prebuilt meshes, or manual modeling. Blender Python procedural geometry and self-generated texture/material workflows are preferred.
- Audit Blender/Python/GPU availability first; do not claim tools or renders ran unless verified.
- Version generator scripts, manifests, tests and small previews; publish large GLB files as versioned artifacts, not normal Git blobs.
- Honor docs/ART_CONTRACT.md; reconcile contract differences with game repo via issues.
- Each asset requires source script, seed/config, deterministic command, geometry checks, GLB export, SHA256 manifest, front and isometric previews, and provenance.
- Quality is judged from actual preview renders; primitive blockouts are not production-quality.
- Never use copyrighted reference meshes or import unlicensed 3D content.
- No auto-merging, destructive actions or paid model/API calls without approval.
## First tasks
ART-001: headless Blender pipeline; ART-002: visual bible/palette; ART-003: house/tree/lamp; ART-004: original adult character and rig feasibility.
## Delivery
Every PR states generated assets, preview locations, commands/tests actually run, quality limitations, Unity compatibility.
